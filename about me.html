<p>
    My Name is Bukho and My Surname is Majama. I live in South Africa, in a small town called Umthatha that is located in the Eastern Cape province.
    There is so much culture and diversity in the province, I personally am a Xhosa ethnetically. This small Town I am from is known as the town where one of the great legends to ever live was born, father Nelson Mandela The freedom Fighter.

    I am a striving young adult, who is passionate in the tech industry and the development of skills, I for one image a world where Africa is rich with skills and overflows with tech innovation.
    The dream I have is developing the town and city that I am from, making it a better place for most of the people, actually I envision myself opening a florishing rehabilitation and vision rebuilding school in my province. Until then, I like working hard and smarter with things, as a great spoken word poet (Suli Breaks) once said, "if you really want to grow trees, pray for rain but do not forget to water your seeds. Chase you dreams!"
